This is the top-level folder for CS3 Project 2, which you will open in vscode.

Each subfolder has Java source files in the corresponding package.

The connectFour subfolder has the interface code (Grid.java and Player.java).

The sample subfolder has the sample player code (SampleRandomPlayer.java).

Start by making a third subfolder with your first name, which is where you will
put all your own Java files for this project.  The SampleRandomPlayer.java file
has an example of how to specify the package (which must match the subfolder name),
and also how to make a class implement an interface.

Here's an example of Arthur's finished project structure:
readme.txt
arthur (subfolder)
 AutomatedPlayer.java
 Board.java
 Game.java
 HumanPlayer.java
 reflection.txt
connectFour (subfolder)
